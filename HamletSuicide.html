	<h1>Suicide</h1>
	<p>
		You know it's sinful and goes against God but you can't take it anymore. The unnatural relationship between the king and queen and the king's complete incompetence as a ruler slowly sap your will to live. In your quarters, you take out your trusty dagger and stab yourself.
		<br>
		You wake up in hell. You may have escaped the situation in Denmark, but you'll be forever tormented by your own thoughts.
