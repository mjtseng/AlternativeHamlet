	<h1>Left Behind and Gone Forever</h1>
	<p> 
			You receive word that sheâ€™s gone completely insane over her broken heart. She spent her last days passing out flowers of betrayal and lost love. Under a clear sky and shining sun, she has drowned herself in a stream, and is being carried away by a bed of blossoms. You on the other hand, successfully make it out of Denmark, to live out your life as a common peasant in France. As you have killed Ophelia through a broken heart and King Claudius, you are headed to hell.
