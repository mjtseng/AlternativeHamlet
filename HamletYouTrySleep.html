	<h1>You Can Only Try to Sleep</h1>
	<p>
	You still can’t sleep, and simply lay among the sheets tossing and turning. The dark figure is still in your bedroom: the ghost of your late father, Old Hamlet. He is still asking for you to avenge his murder by murdering Claudius. 
	</p>
	<p>
	You know he won't leave until you agree - he has an eternity, after all.
