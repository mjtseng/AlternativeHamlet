	<h1>Down to the Foyer</h1>

		The cold night only imposes on your already dark mood. The wind seems to bite and nip at your every step; an owl hoots somewhere in the darkness. Suddenly, a ghostly form appears ahead of you... Is that your dead father??!! He explains that two weeks ago he was murdered by his very own brother, your uncle Claudius. He is stuck in purgatory, and you have to kill your uncle to avenge his death.
