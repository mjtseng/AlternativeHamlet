	<h1>Sailing West?</h1>
	<p>
		You ask a sailor about hitching a ride west. He looks at you like you're stupid and asks why you want to sail west.
	<br>
		Before you can answer, he recognizes you as Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, and takes you back to the palace for the trial.
	<br><br>
		You realize that you can't sail west. That would be sailing further inland into Denmark. The sailor was right, you are stupid.
