			Congratulations! Youâ€™ve broken out of the prison and are now headed for the port, but before you make it there, you remember a very important person: Ophelia, your girlfriend.

			Oh no! Your attempt to flee the country in disguise failed when you were recognized. You are quickly captured and brought back to the palace for trial.
