	<h1>Die, Claudius!</h1>
	<p> 
		The king is sitting on his throne, watching the fencing match. At his side resides a goblet of poisoned wine for the victor, should Hamlet win. The queen, sitting next to him, unwittinly drank some of the wine without knowing of its contents; she dies quietly and enters hell for marrying the brother of her first husband.
