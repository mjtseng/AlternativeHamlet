	<h1>Poison All the Way</h1>
	<p> 

		<h2>
			If you decide to poison the wine: You enter the apothecary to order up a batch of night berries, however, a voice calls out: “Prince Hamlet! How are you doing today? It’s surprising to see you here, were you in need of an ointment?” 
You’re surprised that you were recognized, and had forgotten that obtaining poison would be harder than expected. If you backed out now, you would avoid death for attempted murder.
