		Even though you overwhelm Laertes with your skills, he still manages to score a nick in your arm. You didnâ€™t know it before, but his sword was poisoned. In the scuffle that follows, both of you are cut by the poisoned sword. Quickly, Laertes confesses that he and Claudius conspired to kill you because of your threat to the king and your treatment of Ophelia. He begs for your forgiveness.
